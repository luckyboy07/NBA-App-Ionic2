# NBA-App-Ionic2
A NBA App developed by Ionic2

The purpose of this project is practicing Ionic2 and Angular2, 
and I'm just inspired by this repo: https://github.com/wwayne/react-native-nba-app

So, this project will follow the function and style of repo: https://github.com/wwayne/react-native-nba-app,
the only difference between both is development language, i.e. this project use Ionic2 & Angular2 instead of React Native.
